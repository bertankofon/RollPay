# RollPay

RollPay lets companies manage their entire payroll process on the blockchain without the usual problems. Companies can add employees, set salaries, and send payments to multiple employees at once. All transactions are completely private - no one can see salary amounts or who got paid what. Gas fees? It's handled by Zircuit's EIP-7702 standart, pay the gas using USDC.
